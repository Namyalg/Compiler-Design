The program is to evalute any mathematical expresions 
+, /, -, * and ( )

In the lex it is tokenised and the tokens +, -, *, / are returned 

for the integers, it is converted to integer using atoi and assigned to yylval 

yylval is an extern variable shared between the 2 files, 

is a global variable whose semantic value is shared between the files 

Also add yywrap ? not sure why this is being added though 

YACC file

%token cpb
%left plus minus
%left mult divide 

this is how the tokens are given 

%left associative + - 
%left associative * / 

* / are after + - as they are
