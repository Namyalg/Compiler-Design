The program is to evalute any mathematical expresions 
+, /, -, * and ( )

In the lex it is tokenised and the tokens +, -, *, / are returned 

for the integers, it is converted to integer using atoi and assigned to yylval 

yylval is an extern variable shared between the 2 files, 

is a global variable whose semantic value is shared between the files 

Also add yywrap ? not sure why this is being added though 

YACC file

%token cpb
%left plus minus
%left mult divide 

this is how the tokens are given 

%left  + - 
%left  * / 

* / are after + - as they are having a higher precedence over + and - 
if all operators were to be included as 

%left + - 
%left * /
%right ^ 

Exponent has the highest precedence and is present at the bottom 
It is right to left associative
While the other 2 are left to right associative
